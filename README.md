# ðŸ¤– GRIDMAN 

A software legacy spanning a decade, originally designed for distributed computing with Raspberry Pis, has been refurbished, modernized, and repurposed to harness the computational power of all available machines in my possession. This isn't merely a source code repository; rather, it comprises pages that provide real-time insights into the ongoing computational tasks across the network of nodes.

1. To revive this nearly dormant project, I've developed a BTC Lottery miner. It operates through solo.ckpool.org and utilizes connected nodes to search for nonce, extranonce2, and ntime combinations that produce a double hash (256) of a block header lower than the target. It's a familiar tale of odds, but despite the slim chances of success, it serves as an excellent benchmarking and stress-testing exercise for this decade-old code. Numerous contributors have pooled their resources, often leveraging solar-powered nodes, in hopes of claiming a share of the rewards should fortune smile upon us ðŸ¤ž As is customary with such endeavors, the more nodes involved, the broader the scope of our search. A dedicated git page is [here](https://invpe.github.io/GridMan/) that renders the last status of the search game.
